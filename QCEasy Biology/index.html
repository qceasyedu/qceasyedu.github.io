        <h2>Welcome to QCEasy Biology</h2>
        <p>Your comprehensive resource for mastering Year 12 Biology. Navigate to explore the syllabus, learning goals, practice questions, and contact us for assistance.</p>
<h2>Tackling the QCE Syllabus: Biology</h2>

<p>As a recent graduate, I can relate to the immense pressure you all may feel this year. But, it will be okay! Biology requires memorisation but more so knowing what to write in assignments and your external exam answers. When you eventually start doing practice exams, you'll find that what the markers want is not always what you wrote. And it sucks, I know! So, make sure you address exactly what the question is asking (no sidetracks).
The fact that you've chosen to visit my website demonstrates your commitment to empowering yourself with knowledge. Thank you for your trust, and I hope this resource helps you excel in your biology studies.</p>
<h2>My Goal</h2>
<p>My goal is not about purely being a tutor. My goal is to empower you with what you already have on hand and compile it into an accessible platform.</p>
<h2>About me!</h2>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Miranda Chen and I am a graduate of 2024. I achieved 100% on all assignments in 2024 including the Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics PSMTs and Chemistry, Physics and Biology Student Experiments and Research Investigations. I scored a 99+ ATAR and as a former Year 12 Student, there were some things that I thought I would have loved to have for my studies. The struggle of not having the syllabus, learning goals and definitions on one singular platform. The awkward user experience on notes and collaboration spaces. The videos on the internet where the educator would assume your prior knowledge of topics. They all bugged me, and I just wish I had something simple to use while capturing everything I needed within the subject. So, here it is.
