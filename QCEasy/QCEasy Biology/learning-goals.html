        <h1>Learning Goal Breakdown</h1>
<h1>Topic 1: Describing Biodiversity</h1>
<h2>Subject Matter</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Biodiversity:
        <ul>
            <li>Recognise that biodiversity includes the diversity of species and ecosystems.</li>
            <li>Determine diversity of species using measures such as species richness, evenness, percentage cover, percentage frequency, and Simpson’s diversity index.</li>
            <li>Use species diversity indices, species interactions (predation, competition, symbiosis, disease), and abiotic factors (climate, substrate, size/depth of area) to compare ecosystems across spatial and temporal scales.</li>
            <li>Explain how environmental factors limit the distribution and abundance of species in an ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Mandatory Practical:
        <ul>
            <li>Determine species diversity of a group of organisms based on a given index.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Notional Time: 9 hours</li>
    <li>Additional Guidance:
        <ul>
            <li>Use local context throughout the unit to develop the content objectives.</li>
            <li>Diversity indices and measurements should be supported through fieldwork and based on classification.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Suggested Practical:
        <ul>
            <li>Measure abiotic factors in the classroom using field samples (e.g., pH, nitrogen nutrients, salinity, carbonates, turbidity).</li>
            <li>Measure abiotic factors in the field (e.g., dissolved oxygen, light, temperature, wind speed, infiltration rate).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Classification Processes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Recognise that biological classification can be hierarchical and based on different levels of similarity of physical features, methods of reproduction, and molecular sequences.</li>
    <li>Describe the classification systems for similarity of physical features (the Linnaean system), methods of reproduction (asexual, sexual — K and r selection), molecular sequences (molecular phylogeny — also called cladistics).</li>
    <li>Define the term clade.</li>
    <li>Recall that common assumptions of cladistics include common ancestry, bifurcation, and physical change.</li>
    <li>Notional Time: 12 hours</li>
    <li>Additional Guidance:
        <ul>
            <li>Students should understand that the concept of classification is directly related to the purpose for which the data will be used.</li>
            <li>Students should recognise that the Linnaean system does not rely solely on physical features for classification.</li>
            <li>Classification should be supported by the analysis of field data.</li>
            <li>Identification of applications of molecular phylogeny (DNA barcoding and genetic testing) should be linked to understanding of subject matter in Unit 4.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE)</h2>

    <li>Calculate population growth rate and change (using birth, death, immigration, and emigration data).</li>
    <li>Use the Lincoln Index to estimate population size from secondary or primary data.</li>
    <li>Analyse population growth data to determine the mode of population growth (exponential growth J-curve, logistic growth S-curve).</li>
    <li>Discuss the effect of changes within population-limiting factors on the carrying capacity of the ecosystem.</li>
    <li>Notional Time: 4 hours</li>
</ul>

    <li>Differentiate between the two main modes of succession: primary and secondary.</li>
    <li>Identify the features of pioneer species (ability to fixate nitrogen, tolerance to extreme conditions, rapid germination of seeds, ability to photosynthesise) that make them effective colonisers.</li>
    <li>Analyse ecological data to predict temporal and spatial successional changes.</li>
    <li>Predict the impact of human activity on the reduction of biodiversity and on the magnitude, duration, and speed of ecosystem change.</li>

    <li>Suggested Practical:
        <ul>
            <li>Select and appraise an ecological surveying technique to analyse species diversity between two spatially variant ecosystems of the same classification (e.g. a disturbed and undisturbed dry sclerophyll forest).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Science as a Human Endeavour (SHE)</h2>
