                <li>Esterification.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Describe, using equations, the production of ethanol from fermentation and the hydration of ethene.</li>
        <li>Describe, using equations, the transesterification of triglycerides to produce biodiesel.</li>
        <li>Discuss, using diagrams and relevant half-equations, the operation of a hydrogen fuel cell under acidic and alkaline conditions.</li>
        <li>Calculate yields of chemical synthesis reactions by comparing stoichiometric and actual quantities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Green Chemistry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Appreciate that green chemistry principles include the design of chemical synthesis processes that use renewable raw materials, limit the use of potentially harmful solvents, and minimise the amount of unwanted products.</li>
        <li>Outline the principles of green chemistry and recognise that the higher the atom economy, the 'greener' the process.</li>
        <li>Calculate atom economy and draw conclusions about the economic and environmental impact of chemical synthesis processes.</li>
        <li>100% atom economy equates to all the atoms in the reactants being converted to the desired product.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Macromolecules: Polymers, Proteins, and Carbohydrates</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe, using equations, how addition polymers can be produced from their monomers including polyethene (LDPE and HDPE), polypropene, and polytetrafluorethene.</li>
        <li>Describe, using equations, how condensation polymers, including polypeptides (proteins), polysaccharides (carbohydrates), and polyesters, can be produced from their monomers.</li>
        <li>Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of polymer use, including strength, density, lack of reactivity, use of natural resources, and biodegradability.</li>
        <li>Describe the condensation reaction of 2-amino acids to form polypeptides (involving up to three amino acids), and understand that polypeptides (proteins) are formed when amino acid monomers are joined by peptide bonds.</li>
        <li>Describe the condensation reaction of monosaccharides to form disaccharides (lactose, maltose, and sucrose) and polysaccharides (starch, glycogen, and cellulose), and understand that polysaccharides are formed when monosaccharide monomers are joined by glycosidic bonds.</li>
        <li>The common names, symbol, structural formula, and pH of the isoelectric point for amino acids are given in the Chemistry data booklet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Molecular Manufacturing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Appreciate that molecular manufacturing processes involve the positioning of molecules to facilitate a specific chemical reaction; such methods have the potential to synthesise specialised products, including proteins, carbon nanotubes, nanorobots, and chemical sensors used in medicine.</li>
    </ul>
