        <h2>Welcome to QCEasy 11</h2>
        <p>Your comprehensive resource for mastering Year 11 Subjects. Navigate to explore the Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Mathematical Methods platforms and contact us for assistance.</p>
<h2>Tackling the QCE Syllabus</h2>

<p>I'll let you in on my secret: Year 11 is hard. The jump between Year 10 and Year 11 will be tough because it's the first time you step foot into senior high school. The longer assignments, harder exams and larger amount of workload means that time management is essential. For the first time in your entire life, you must pass to obtain QCE points. And if you're anything like me, you will be stressed, but that is just your body's way of adapting. Push through, time manage, and you'll be all good!

The fact that you've chosen to visit my website demonstrates your commitment to empowering yourself with knowledge. Thank you for your trust, and I hope this resource helps you excel in your studies.</p>

<h2>My Goal</h2>
<p>My goal is not about purely being a tutor. My goal is to empower you with what you already have on hand and compile it into an accessible platform.</p>
<h2>About me!</h2>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Miranda Chen and I am a graduate of 2024. I achieved 100% on all assignments in 2024 including the Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics PSMTs and Chemistry, Physics and Biology Student Experiments and Research Investigations. I scored a 99+ ATAR and as a former Year 12 Student, there were some things that I thought I would have loved to have for my studies. The struggle of not having the syllabus, learning goals and definitions on one singular platform. The awkward user experience on notes and collaboration spaces. The videos on the internet where the educator would assume your prior knowledge of topics. They all bugged me, and I just wish I had something simple to use while capturing everything I needed within the subject. So, here it is.
