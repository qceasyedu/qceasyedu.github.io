      <li><strong>Passive Immunity</strong>: Immunity conferred by receiving antibodies from another source, such as from mother to child or via antibody injections.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Naturally Acquired Passive Immunity</strong>: Transfer of antibodies from mother to infant (e.g., breast milk).</li>
          <li><strong>Artificially Acquired Passive Immunity</strong>: Transfer of antibodies through medical treatments like antivenom or monoclonal antibodies.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Infectious Disease Transmission</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Modes of Disease Transmission</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Direct Contact</strong>: Physical transfer of pathogens (e.g., touching an infected person).</li>
          <li><strong>Contact with Body Fluids</strong>: Transmission through fluids like blood, saliva, or semen (e.g., HIV, hepatitis).</li>
          <li><strong>Contaminated Food or Water</strong>: Ingestion of pathogens through contaminated food or drinking water (e.g., cholera, norovirus).</li>
          <li><strong>Disease-Specific Vectors</strong>: Organisms (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks) that transmit diseases to humans (e.g., malaria, Lyme disease).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Disease Spread and Control</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Factors Affecting Disease Spread</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Persistence of Pathogens</strong>: How long pathogens can survive in the environment or within a host.</li>
          <li><strong>Transmission Mechanism</strong>: How easily and through which means the pathogen spreads.</li>
          <li><strong>Immunity Proportion</strong>: The percentage of the population that is immune to the disease or has been vaccinated.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobility of Individuals</strong>: The ease with which people travel, contributing to the spread of diseases.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Control Measures</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal Hygiene</strong>: Practices like handwashing and using disinfectants to reduce pathogen spread.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact Tracing</strong>: Identifying and monitoring individuals who have come into contact with an infected person.</li>
          <li><strong>Quarantine</strong>: Isolating infected individuals to prevent the spread to others.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Long-term Immune Response Data</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Epidemiological Data</strong>: Using data to track and predict the course of disease outbreaks, identify sources, and determine control strategies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Innate Immune Response in Plants</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physical Defence Strategies</strong>: Structural features like thick cell walls, waxy cuticles, and leaf structures that prevent pathogen entry.</li>
      <li><strong>Chemical Defence Strategies</strong>: Production of toxins, enzymes, and plant defensins to deter or kill pathogens.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Scientific Inquiry</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Antimicrobial Agents</strong>: Substances that kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms (e.g., antibiotics, antiseptics).</li>
      <li><strong>Zones of Inhibition</strong>: Areas around an antimicrobial agent where microbial growth is prevented, measured to assess the effectiveness of the agent.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Vaccination and Immunization</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mass Vaccination Programs</strong>: Large-scale efforts to immunize populations against infectious diseases (e.g., smallpox, polio, influenza).</li>
      <li><strong>Vaccine Development</strong>: The process of creating vaccines to stimulate immune responses and prevent diseases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>First Nations' Knowledge</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bush Medicines</strong>: Traditional healing practices using local plants and natural substances, which have been used by First Nations peoples for centuries to prevent and treat infections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
